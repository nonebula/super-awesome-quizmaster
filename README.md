# super-awesome-quizmaster
A quizmaster game designed using Javascript fundamentals to build and store data from a quiz to test Bootcamp students' knowledge.

## Description 
The goal of this project was to deliver a quiz program that met specific criteria including use of DOM manipulation and advanced JavaScript functions. Due to the nature of this project, there was no creation of html or css elements and I did not format the html page in any way other than was provided as a starter template.

## Usage 
The page demonstrates full functionality. Click on 'Start Quiz' to commence the quiz. Work your way through the questions but be careful not to get too many questions wrong because a wrong answer will subtract 10 seconds from the timer! Stack up on those correct answers though, because they'll add 10 seconds back to the timer, too! Once you have completed the quiz, you will be prompted to provide your initials and if you're lucky, you'll find yourself on the scoreboard. If you want to clear the scoreboard or go back to the homepage, simply click the buttons below the scoreboard and they'll do exactly what you would expect them to. Happy quizzing and good luck!

## Credits

The project was completed independently but built off the source code from: edX Boot Camps LLC. I worked with a friend, Sam Millar, to explore the fundamentals of Javascript and clarify my work. I also worked through the modules on Codecademy to better develop my understanding to enable me to solve these challenges. In producing this webpage, I also utilized a range of tutorials from W3 Schools and referred to multiple posts on Stack Overflow. I also utilized the support of the course teaching assistants and my tutor, Juan Delgado.
